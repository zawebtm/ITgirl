My first IT project to " learn, girl ! "

I want to do a project related to my city ( Bytom ) . It is old town and has got complicated history. It was a German , and now it is Polish town . Lived here Poles, Germans , Jews, Lvovians . It was a rich and beautiful city  , but now it has got problems. People are sad , and they do not remember or do not appreciate the story. A few years ago, I find old German subtitles ( any style of advertising days ) on building's walls. New paint came down , and underneath there is old fashioned advertising , I felt like treasures hunter.

I started taking photography and made guide. Now I would like to make it's version on the Internet , it would be great if people could explore this subtitle , and can find a new subtitle , can add a photo to the data address / GPS . I want to make people more interested in their town , it would be great if they also  feel like an adventure hunters ; )

I hope that it will be only the first but not the last reminder of my Bytom. I have some ideas for the guide .
